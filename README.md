# 🗺 Hyeong Geon's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! More will be added as I complete public projects.


| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 👩🏻‍⚕️ [AI Lung Cancer Image Detection](https://github.com/jtn50/lungdeepfake/tree/main) | August 2025 | Python, Tensorflow, Keras, EDA | Collaborated within a team to develop and test multiple ML models for detecting and labeling AI altered images pertaining to CT scans of Lung cancer. The models include both hyperparameterization and summary statistics to determine the quality of each model. |
| 📺 [Football Transfer Success Analysis](https://github.com/kim-hyeonggeon/data205-neo4j) | Apr 2025 | Python, Neo4j, Cypher (Done within Neo4j) | Worked within a team to create and analyze Neo4j graphs for determining success on transfers within Football (Soccer) clubs. |
| 👩🏻‍⚕️ [NLP ML Brain to Text](https://github.com/hyeonggeonkim-berkeley/mids-w266-fall2025-vishnu-geon) | Dec 2025 | Python, Transformers, RNNs, Pytorch | An exploration piece with a research style article developing and training different AI model archicetures with the goal of converting brain signals to text following a challenge hosted on kaggle posted by [Nicholas S Card's lab.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brain-to-text-25/overview) |
| 📺 ML Load testing on AWS | Dec 2025 | Python, Kubernetes, Poetry, Docker, Grafana, Istio | Though a link is unavailable to the public, this project involved deploying a huggingface ai model calculating sentiment to aws and loadbalancing via Kubernetes. Further caching was added via SimpleRedisCache to lower server load. Version Control was done via Poetry and Docker Containerization. Finally, Loadtesting was done via K6 Grafana and monitering was done through Istio.|
